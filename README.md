A collection of scripts aimed at customizing desktops under the KISS principle

The whole of this repo is definitely still a work in progress. I'll be adding customizations I've made to my own desktop once I feel I've made them modular enough for general purpose use, but don't expect sparkling clean style if you crack one of these open and look at the source code.

##Scripts:
  scheme.py- overlay a group of colors over an established color scheme.
