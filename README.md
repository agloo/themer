# themer
A collection of scripts aimed at customizing desktops under the unix philosophy.

I'll be adding the tools I use whenever they end up polished enough for public use.

##Scripts:
###scheme.py

Overlay a group of colors over an established color scheme.

Requirements: Just python 3. [colors](http://git.2f30.org/colors/log.html) recommended to get a color scheme that matches your wallpaper.

For Example:
![schemepoc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13296002/19587746/99e1e82a-9715-11e6-9bd3-a4f8e9eb5cba.jpg)

###colormod.py

Manipulate the values of a list of colors, passed in by hex value.

Currently supports a continous series of pairwise gradients, along with lightening/darkening.

For Example:
![pocgrad](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13296002/20338901/75fdba8c-ab8e-11e6-9d75-01818f101eec.jpg)
